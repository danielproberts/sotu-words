# State of the Union Word Analysis
Jupyter Notebook Analyzing Word Usage in State of the Union Addresses (1790 - Present)


## Description

The purpose of this project is to analyze word usage in Presidential State of the Union Addresses to determine if there is a trend towards speaking more of "War" or speaking more of "Peace".  This is accomplished using a dataset of all SOTU Addresses, split into individual ".txt" files, which was obtained from [State of the Union Address Texts](https://www.kaggle.com/tathor/state-of-the-union-address-texts).


## Included Libraries / Dependencies

* matplotlib.pyplot (as plt) - Version 2.2.2
* pandas (as pd)  - Version 0.23.0

* re - Version 2.2.1


## Instructions

1. Download entire Repository.
2. Open sotu-notebook.ipynb.
3. Run each cell in order using Shift-Enter.


## Conclusions

The data shows a general downward trend in use of both studied words, a trend which accelerated after the end of the Cold War.  Overall, there is a greater prevalence of the word "War" than the word "Peace" across all addresses.
